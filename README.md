# 📙 Math notebooks <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

A collection of all my math notebooks accumulated in my road to learning Machine Learning and become a Machine Learning engineer.

## Content

- [🇪🇸 Basic knowledge](00-basic-knowledge/)
- [🇪🇸 1º High School](01-high-school/README.md)

## Next steps

Currently I'm finishing the [🇪🇸 1º High School](01-high-school/README.md) book and my next steps are:

* [2º High School book](http://apuntesmareaverde.org.es/grupos/mat/Bachillerato/MatematicasII.htm)
* [MML book](https://mml-book.github.io/)

## Why

I first started using [Notion](https://notion.so/) for creating this notebooks but as they started to grow in length and be more complex I needed a more organised way to store them. I found that [docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/) satisfied all my current needs so, here we are.

I publish these notebooks because hopefully with them, I can help some people and spread some love for mathematics and science.
